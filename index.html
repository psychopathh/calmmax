          <div class="subtitle">Depression is a dangerous disease that affects 93% of modern people</div>
          <div class="text">Over 80% of people suffering from depression think about suicide, a quarter of them make at least one attempt to kill themselves. Often they will eventually succeed.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="right_side">
          <div class="text">Doctors claim, depression is the main cause of deterioration in people's lives, staying away from work, retiring into one’s self, and loss of ability to work. Accompanied by continuous stress, depression harms a person's health, worsens appearance and shortens one's life.</div>
          <div class="text_container">
            <div class="title">However</div>
            <div class="description">It is important to understand that depression is not so much an external effect as an internal one. In most cases of depression there are no external causes, and all negative thoughts are created internally by the depressed person. And it has certain physiological causes. In the overwhelming majority of cases, depression is a consequence of certain health problems and a lack of development of “happiness hormones”.</div>

              <div class="box">A wonderful product. It helped me to survive a difficult period in my life. An important benefit of CALMAX over conventional sedatives is that CALMAX does not cause drowsiness and inhibition, but it seems to work in the opposite. It simply restores the body and improves mood. And as you stop taking CALMAX, the mood does not deteriorate, and the strength does not vanish. A very good and inexpensive solution. </div>

              <div class="box">I enjoyed CALMAX very much. I had a serious deep depression after a divorce – I didn’t want to live, didn’t know what to do, and how to survive this period. CALMAX helped me out. To be honest, I did not really believe in it, but my sister insisted that I should take it. As a result, my emotional state improved significantly. Now I'm back to a normal life, I'm dating a new girl. I advise CALMAX to everyone. It will help. </div>

          <p>Before using a supplement you are unfamiliar with, find out its medicinal properties. Research it thoroughly and/or consult with an appropriately qualified practitioner or expert. If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition check with an appropriately qualified practitioner before using herbs medicinally.
